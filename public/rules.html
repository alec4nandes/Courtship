            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Each player starts off with 60 HP and 5 cards</li>

                <li>
                    Each hand plays 1-4 numbered cards with an optional court
                    card
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hearts are recovery points, other suits are attack
                        points
                    </li>
                    <li>Must play at least one numbered card</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Players cannot move if they have only court cards —
                            they must pull another card
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        More numbered cards are played alongside a court card.
                        The rank of the court card determines the extra cards
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No court cards: 1 numbered card only</li>
                        <li>Jack: 2 numbered cards</li>
                        <li>Queen: 3 numbered cards</li>
                        <li>King: 4 numbered cards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Can only play one court card per turn</li>
                    <li>
                        Each player must have at least 5 cards at the start of
                        every turn, unless the draw pile is exhausted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players can decide to draw without playing any cards
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Turns are for either recovery points, where the numbered
                    cards are all Hearts, or attack points, where the numbered
                    cards are not Hearts. A court card can always be any suit
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recovery points return HP to the player</li>
                    <li>Attack points reduce the HP of the opponent</li>
                    <li>
                        A turn can only be for one kind of point. No mixing
                        Hearts with other suits in the numbered cards.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>Point calculation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Double a card’s points if it is same suit as court card
                        just played by opponent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double total attack or recovery points if court card is
                        same suit as a court card just played by opponent.
                        Example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Opponent plays Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 8 of
                            Spades
                        </li>
                        <li>You take 5+8=13 points damage</li>
                        <li>
                            Then you play Queen of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 7 of
                            Diamonds, and 2 of Spades
                        </li>
                        <li>Opponent takes 2(5*2+7+2) = 38 points damage</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Play until someone runs out of HP, or cards are exhausted
                    (highest HP wins)
                </li>
            </ul>
