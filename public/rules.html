            <ul>
                <li>Each player starts off with 60 HP and 5 cards</li>

                <li>
                    Each hand plays 1-4 numbered cards with an optional court
                    card
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each hand must play at least one numbered card</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Players with only court cards cannot play a hand.
                            They must pull another card
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        A court card calls for more numbered cards in a hand.
                        The rank of the court card determines the extra cards
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No court cards: 1 numbered card only</li>
                        <li>Jack: 2 numbered cards</li>
                        <li>Queen: 3 numbered cards</li>
                        <li>King: 4 numbered cards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Players can only play one court card per turn</li>
                    <li>
                        Players must have at least 5 cards at the start of each
                        turn. If a player has less than 5 cards after playing
                        their hand, they must draw cards until they have 5,
                        unless the draw pile is exhausted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For each turn, players can either draw a card or play a
                        hand
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Turns are for either recovery points, where the numbered
                    cards are all Hearts, or attack points, where the numbered
                    cards are not Hearts. A court card can always be any suit
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recovery points return HP to the player</li>
                    <li>Attack points reduce the HP of the opponent</li>
                    <li>
                        A turn can only be for one kind of point. No mixing
                        Hearts with other suits in the numbered cards.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>Point calculation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Double a card's points if it is the same suit as a court
                        card just played by the opponent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double the total attack or recovery points if the
                        player's court card is the same suit as a court card
                        just played by the opponent. Example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Opponent plays Jack of Clubs, 8 of Spades, and 5 of
                            Clubs
                        </li>
                        <li>You take 8 + 5 = 13 points damage</li>
                        <li>
                            Then you play Queen of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, 4 of
                            Clubs, and 2 of Spades
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Opponent takes 2(7 + 4*2 + 2) = 34 points damage
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    Play until someone runs out of HP, or the draw pile and
                    hands are exhausted (highest HP wins)
                </li>
            </ul>
