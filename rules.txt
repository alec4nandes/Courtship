Each player starts off with 60 HP and 5 cards

Each hand plays 1-4 numbered cards with an optional court card
    Hearts are recovery points, other suits are attack points
    Must play at least one numbered card
    Additional numbered cards can be played alongside a court card. The rank of the court card determines the extra cards
        No court cards: 1 numbered card
        Jack: 2 numbered cards
        Queen: 3 numbered cards
        King: 4 numbered cards
    Can only play one court card per turn
    Each player must have at least 5 cards at the start of every turn
        Cards are replaced from a draw pile
        Players can decide to draw without playing any cards
        Players cannot move if they have only court cards — they must pull another card

Turns are either recovery (all numbered Hearts), or attack (numbered mix of other suits)
    The suits of the court cards can vary 

Point calculation (numbered Hearts = recovery, numbered other suits = attack)
    Double a card’s points if it is same suit as court card just played by opponent
    Double total attack or recovery points if court card is same suit as court card just played by opponent. Example:
        Opponent plays Jack of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, and 8 of Spades
            You take 5+8=13 points damage
        You play Queen of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds, and 2 of Spades
            Opponent takes 2(5*2+7+2) = 38 points damage

Play until someone runs out of HP, or cards are exhausted (highest HP wins)
